# tasks

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

 Simple Flow:

Call API → Get dummy data (looks real)

Show in UI → With loading/error states

Ready for real API → Just replace dummy data

What We Have:

User API → Profile data

Flights API → Flight offers

Search API → Services & suggestions

overall:

Using dummy API structure (not real calls)

Same format as real backend will use
